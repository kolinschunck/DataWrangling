## Key Insights for Presentation

Renting a bike from Bay Wheel's bike service is a great way to move around the city or SF Bay area, either for pleasure or work. Two types of customer groups are identfied: (1) Subscribers and (2) Casual Riders. Subscribers use the service mainly for commuting to/from work, whereas Casual Riders are most likely tourists or occassional riders to use the service for exploring the Bay area. Further, subscribers represent the largest group (81%) who rent a bike during the weekdays mostly between 7am-9am as well as 4pm-6pm. There are also minor usages during lunch hours. The subscriber group should be handled with care by Bay Wheel's as they are the largest group, having a great impact on the overall business for the company.

### Trend Insight 1: Subscribers are the heavy-user group of the bike ride system
Customers with a monthly membership ("Subscriber") make 81% of all customers in FY 2019 that used the system. 19% were casual riders ("Customer") using the bike share system ocasionally, upon demand. Casual riders ("Customer") continously increase in terms of absolute figures in FY 2019. Monthly membership users stayed on avg. relatively stable, with a sharp decline beginning in November. This is most likely b/c of the beginning of the winter season. Monthly subscribers then probably pause or cancel their membership and re-activate it once the winter season is over.

### Trend Insight 2: Usage varies by user groups significantly
Customers with a monthly subscription use the bike ride system for approx. 12 min. per bike ride on average. The surprising fact is that casual riders almost use the system twice as long, namely 23 min. The average distance also varies slightly, as casual riders ride on average 1.75 miles, whereas subscription members ride 1.25 on average. This confirms the overall findings that subscribers use the system to go to/from work, wherea casual riders could be tourists or others spending time in the SF Bay Area to explore certain areas of the city.

### Trend Insight 3: Subscribers are more active during weekdays, whereas the opposite is true for casual riders

-- weekdays: most bike rides hapen around 8-9am and 5-6pm with the peak on Fridays around 5pm
-- weekends: most bike rides happen between 10am - 8pm with the peak on Saturdays around 2pm
- Subscribers use the bike sharing system mainly on weekdays:
-- weekdays: most bike rides hapen around 8-9am and 5-6pm with the peak on Tuesdays around 8am
